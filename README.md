## Description
For this project the goal was to make a node application that would allow a user to build a sort of work team profile. With the Inquirer module, the user would be prompted questions that would allow for them to fit employees into certain roles and provide role specific information about those employees. This project involved building class objects, using sub classes, and a whole lot of functions.

## Installation
To use this app you will need to make sure that you have the Inquirer module installed. You can do this by typing in "npm install inquirer" in your terminal under this folder.

## Usage 
This application is fairly simply to use. Basically you run node on the app.js file and you will begin to be prompted questions. By answering the questions, this application will be able to write a Team Member html page for you.
Here is a link that shows the process of answering the prompts in the terminal: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14XyUV0X6C7BVnpUJpz4yoMCE7zSwM-XU/view
